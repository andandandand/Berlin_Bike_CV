# Bike Map: Using Computer Vision for Bike Trip Routing

## About the project
We wanted to build a tool that optimises cycling around Berlin by avoiding cobblestones and giving preference to safe bike paths. We do this by using up-to-date street view images of Berlin to classify streets based on their surface and safety. 

## Background
Cycling is one of the most popular forms of transport in the city, however, there are over 6,000 reported bicycle accidents every year. This excludes all minor, unreported accidents that people have every day. Berliners also battle daily with cobbled streets, which are uncomfortable and can be extremely dangerous in wet conditions. 
However, initiatives like pop-up bike lanes increased bicyle traffic by 25% since their introduction. Pop-up bike lanes are segregated cycle paths that often take the place of a lane of traffic and many such lanes have become permanent fixtures. Safety and comfort while riding a bike remain important factors for people, increasing both would see even more people cycling.

## Plan of action
We therefore set out to automate the detection of bike lanes and road surface using computer vision models and classification. Using street view images from Mapillary.com, we were able to access over 10 million recent pictures of Berlin (in lieu of Google street view images). 

# Happy cycling!
